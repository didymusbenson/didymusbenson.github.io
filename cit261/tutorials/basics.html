            <h2>Primatives</h2>
            <div class="cols">
            <p>
                Lets start with the primative datatypes of JavaScript. You've got <em>Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, and Symbol</em> which are your "primatives" (non-objects without methods).
            </p>
                <p><em>Booleans</em> hold a value of "true" or "false"; <em>Nulls</em> have one value: null; <em>Undefined</em> variables do not have a value at all.</p>

                <p> <em>Numbers</em> have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">specific definition</a> that represent a value between -(2<sup>53</sup> - 1) and 2<sup>53</sup> - 1. There is no difference between integers and floats in JS. </p>

                <p>
                    <em>Strings</em> are made up of text data. There's a little more to it than that, but for our purposes, that's what you need to know.
                </p>
                <p>You probably haven't heard of <em>symbols</em> yet. They are a new primative introduced in ECMAScript Edition 6. They are a unique and immutable value that can be used as the key of an Object. Symbols are called atoms. Here's the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol">MDN page</a> about symbols.</p>

            <h2>Objects (Arrays)</h2>
            <div class="cols">
            <p>
               As MDN puts it: "an object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an identifier." For this review, we are most concerned with the following object types: Arrays, Dates, Functions, and JSONs (covered in another presentation).
            </p>
                <p>An <em>Array</em> is a list of variables that can be accessed by an index. The array ["A", "B", "C"], for example contains three string values. The values of an array can be accessed using an index key. See the following code example:</p>
            <pre>var array = ["A", "B", "C"];
console.log(array[0]);
</pre>
                <p>
                    The output of this code would be "A". Arrays have several properties and methods that are helpful for manipulating the object data. The two properties that we care about are <em>Array.length</em>, which tells you how many items are in the array, and <em>Array.prototype</em>, which allows you to use certain methods on the individual values within the array.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some Array.prototype methods to know are <em>.push()</em> (adds items to the end of the array), <em>.pop()</em> (removes the last element from the array and returns it), <em>.indexOf()</em> (tells you the first index of an element in the array with the value you send in), and <em>.toString()</em> (returns a string that represents all of the elements of the array).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can learn more about arrays <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">here</a> on MDN.

            <h2>Objects (Dates)</h2>
            <div class="cols">
            <p>
               I'm not going to lie. In all the time I've been writing Javascript. I have maybe used Date objects once. If you would actually like to learn something about Dates, feel free to read up on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date">MDN</a>. Below are some code examples for syntax:
            </p>
            <p>
                Fun fact: If you initialize a date with a value higher than normally possible (32 days in a month, 13 months in a year), the date object will move
            </p>

            </div>
              <pre>// Get current datetime
var date = new Date();
// get the day of that date
date.getDay();
// get month, full year (4 digits)
// milliseconds, and minutes all
// follow the same pattern
</pre>
